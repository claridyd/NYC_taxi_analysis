NYC Taxi Analysis for Final Project

Our goal is to predict taxi fares based on trip distance.  There are two notebooks where analysis was done. 

The Local_taxi notebook contains the analysis using a smaller dataset.  Testing was done using 100,000 records.

The taxi_prod notebook analyses data from Google's BigQuery NYC yellow taxi data for the month of July 2015.  The entire year of data was over 146 million rows so we chose to use July 2015 which yielded over 6 million rows.
